# GTOC13-Trajectory-Optimization

This repository contains trajectory optimization code developed for the Global Trajectory Optimization Competition 13 (GTOC13) by the team Yume Space.
This work does not reproduce the best-known solution achieved by the School of Aerospace Engineering, Tsinghua University, Laboratory of Astrodynamics, which reached a score of 345.216.
However, this repository explores multiple optimization strategies for the GTOC13 problem and demonstrates how to reach a solution scoring around 50 points (not officially validated by the competition checker).

The repository compares several methods used to approach this result, and will later be complemented by a detailed guide explaining the implemented techniques and modeling choices.
The problem statement and its associated data can be found on the following (website)[https://gtoc.jpl.net/gtoc13/]
## Overview
This project covers several approaches, including evolutionary algorithms, reinforcement learning techniques, direct single-shooting methods, and indirect optimal-control shooting.


This code is intended as an experimentation toolbox for the GTOC13 Problem.
